# breast_cancer_data_model
Breast Cancer Data Classification 🩺
This project uses real-world diagnostic data to build a neural network model that classifies breast cancer cases as either malignant or benign. It is inspired by leading data science repo formats and emphasizes clean code, readability, and visual reporting for collaborators and learners.

🧹 Data Preparation & Exploration
Columns: Includes features like radius, texture, perimeter, area, and others calculated from cell nuclei in breast tissue images.

--> Missing Values: All null values were handled—either dropped or imputed.

--> Target: The diagnosis column with values “M” (malignant) and “B” (benign).

🔧 Features & Steps
--> Handling Missing Values: Removed columns with NaNs and imputed minor gaps.

--> Encoding Labels: Diagnosis is encoded as 0 (Benign) and 1 (Malignant).

--> Scaling: StandardScaler applied to all features for MLP efficiency.

--> Visualization: Distribution plots and confusion matrix added for insight.

🛠️ Technologies Used

--> Python

--> Pandas & NumPy

--> Matplotlib & Seaborn

--> Scikit-learn (MLPClassifier for neural network)

🔍 Project Workflow

--> Data loading and exploratory analysis

--> Preprocessing: clean, encode, scale

--> Train/test split (80/20)

--> Train MLP neural network model

--> Model Evaluation: accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix

--> Visualize & interpret results

📈 Results
--> Accuracy: 99%

📌 Conclusion
This neural network model provides accurate and interpretable predictions for breast cancer diagnosis using multi-feature medical imaging data. Improvements can be made with feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, or deeper models.
